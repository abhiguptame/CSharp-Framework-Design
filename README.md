# C# Framework Design

## Designing Framework:
### => A software framework in computer programming is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.

### => A framework can be a library of code that performs a special task or a more complicated foundation in our codebase that handles complex systems, and even renders logic critical for our application to run.

### => .NET is a collection of APIs and services that help us speed up our own development.

## 1. When Writting Our Framework:
### => It's important to keep in mind that we'll want to create a goal and find the simplest solution to achieve it.

## 2. Designing Frameworks:
### => Requires a lot of planning and special architecture consideration.

## 3. What a Framework Represents:
### => A core pillar of a project's code, it needs to be bug free, easy to implement, and more important , scalable for future changes or additions to the codebase.

## 4. Portability (The Final Components):
### => The final component of any good framework is portability - whether we can isolate our framework and easily share it with others.

### => Good code architecture is not just about coding - it is about not trying to reinvent the wheel.

## Try to Answer the Following Things While Developing a Framework:
### => 1) Is there an existing library that does what we are trying to do?
### => 2) Can the framework stand on its own? If not, what does it depend on and will others be able to use it?
### => 3) How can we simplify the functionality of the framework to its core components and only include that in your code?

## What Sharing a Framework Requires:
### => 1. Clean API architecture
### => 2. Documentation
### => 3. Clear functionality
